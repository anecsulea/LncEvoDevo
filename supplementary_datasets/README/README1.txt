This supplementary dataset contains the genome annotations used in all analyses. The GTF files (FullAnnotations_${species}.gtf) contain Ensembl 94 annotations and the gene models annotated with StringTie that do not overlap with Ensembl-annotated genes, as described in Methods. The GeneInfo_${species}.txt files contain detailed information on each locus, including genomic localization, protein-coding potential, promoter class, overlap with enhancers etc. The column "CandidateLncRNA" indicates whether the loci were retained in our lncRNA dataset. The column "SelectedProteinCoding" indicates the protein-coding genes that are detected with RNA-seq in our samples.
