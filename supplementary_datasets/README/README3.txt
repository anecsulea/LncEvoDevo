This supplementary dataset contains information on expression variations across organs and developmental stages for lncRNAs and protein-coding genes.

Statistics_AverageTPM_${species}.txt: this file contains average TPM levels for each organ/developmental stage combination, expression specificity measures, sample in which maximum expression is reached, maximum expression level etc.

GeneList_OrganStageMarkers_MouseRat_${organ}_${stage}.txt: this file contains the lists of protein-coding genes that are narrowly expressed (expression specificity value >= 0.85, TPM>=2) in a given organ/developmental stage combination, in both mouse and rat.

GOEnrichment_BiologicalProcess_OrganStageMarkers_MouseRat_${organ}_${stage}.txt: this file contains gene ontology enrichment results, for the organ/developmental stage markers defined above.
