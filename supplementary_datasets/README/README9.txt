This supplementary dataset contains the lists of predicted mouse-specific and rat-specific candidate lncRNAs (for which the genomic loci are well aligned between the two species, but expression is detected in only one of the two species). Two sets of candidate species-specific lncRNAs are provided, one applying a threshold of at least 100 RNA-seq reads, and the other of at least 250 reads, for the species in which the lncRNA is detected.
